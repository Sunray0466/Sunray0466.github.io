      <h4>The central idea behind your project</h4>
      <p>In our project, we wish to deepen our understanding of the movie industry and the people who work in it. We aim to further our understanding 
      of what movie genres are popular with the most central figures in the industry and understand what terms and descriptive words make up the summaries of the movies.</p>
      
      <h4>What is the idea?</h4>
      <p>The main idea is to create a network of movies and crew by collecting data about a lot of movies and then collecting data about the crews that worked on those same movies. A network can then be constructed based on what crew and actors have worked in what movies. The analysis will consist of centrality on a weighted bipartite network of movie/crew connections and centrality of the crew. Text analysis will be carried out on the overview of the movies, mainly focusing on TF-IDF.</p>
      
      <h4>Why is it interesting?</h4>
      <p>The movie industry is one of the most well-known industries in the world with some of the most famous people. Additionally, there are more people than just the actors important in creating movies. We will call this combination of cast and crew ‘members’. Although some members are well known, the network behind all of the ‘entertainment magic’ is not as public.</p>
      <p class="default">Actress Elizabeth Stenmoen talks about the importance of such a network on her LinkedIn, mentioning: “In an industry that thrives on collaboration, it’s not just about who you know, but who knows you. [...] Building genuine relationships with casting directors, producers, fellow actors, and others in the industry creates a safety net. When someone vouches for an actor’s talent or work ethic, they are more likely to be considered for roles, even if they might not fit the initial part for which they auditioned.”  (https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/importance-networking-entertainment-industry-elizabeth-stenmoen/)</p>
      <p class="default">Exploring central figures and differences between the movie genres might be interesting to people to find the people they have to target while networking to potentially have an easier entry into this industry.</p>

      <h4>Which datasets did you need to explore the idea?</h4>
      <p>Our dataset needed to include information about movies, their genres and their descriptions, as well as information about the people who have been working on creating such.</p>
      
      <h4>How did you download them?</h4>
      <p>Our datasets have been retrieved from themoviedb using their publicly available API. This source has been deemed the most reliable and holds a lot of information, nevertheless, it still has some drawbacks, most importantly that bulk requests are not available and the movie and cast information had to be requested one by one.</p>
      <p class="default">Overall, we have gathered information about movies from 2000 to 2024 with the original language being English. Note: In the description of TMDb it is explained, that the data has been added back to 2008. However, we have realised that there is also more information available before this date and have tried to collect as much of it as possible.</p>
      <p class="default">First, general information about the movies based on their release date and their original language (English) has been gathered. After filtering this data, mainly removing movies flagged with ‘adult’, more information has been gathered for each of them. Next, the cast and crew have been requested. Finally, the cast and crew have been processed, including creating a list of movies the person has worked on.</p>
      <p class="default">We have two main datasets that can be linked using the movie ID:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>The movie dataset contains information about movies from 2000-2024 that are available in English. The cleaned dataset consists of 199.897 movies
          There is a lot of information available on each of the movies including the title, original_language, genre, cast, crew and many more.</li>
        <li>The 'member' dataset contains information about the cast and crew working on the listed movies. The cleaned dataset holds 1.018.104 people, 
          including information about their name, known department, popularity, and the movie IDs they have worked in.</li>
      </ol>

      <h4>What is the network you will be analyzing?</h4>
      <p>The network is a bipartite network consisting of connections between movies and their production crew and cast. The network is structured such that each node represents either a movie or a member of the production crew or cast, with edges indicating the participation of the crew or cast in the movie. This configuration allows for an exploration of collaborative relationships within the film industry.</p>
      <p class="default">The network consists of 55.037 nodes and 131.446 edges. To understand the potential scope of connection in this network, we calculated the maximum number of edges if every possible pair of nodes were connected: 1.514.508.166, being adjusted as the network is bipartite. The question we wanted to answer with this analysis was: <strong>What movie genres are the most populated with the central figures in the movie industry?</strong></p>
      
      <h4>What is the text you will be analyzing?</h4>
      <p>We will be analysing the overview of the movies for each genre to provide insights into the differences and similarities between them. The question we wanted to answer with this analysis was: <strong>How do linguistic features in movie overviews vary by movie genre?</strong></p>
      
      <h4>How will you tie the two together?</h4>
      <p>The two are tied together through the analysis of the network's natural community partitions - the movie genres. While the network analysis consists of investigating actors and crew within movie genres, the textual analysis investigates the linguistic and semantic differences between the overviews of different movie genres, giving a combined deeper understanding of the different genres, which are the network communities.</p>

      <h1>Graph</h1>
      <p>By connecting movie genres with movie crew and cast (refered to members in this work) a bipartite graph can be extracted, 
        with weights equal to number of movies a member has worked on before, which contains a given genre. As movie can have multiple genres, 
        a lot of members have worked in a few genre once. 
        We therefore apply a threshold level of minimum 5 movies which had the same genre in before an edge can be established. </p>
      <div class="center"><img src="imgs/graph_custom.png" alt="Bipartite graph with genre and member" width="70vw" style="object-fit: cover; aspect-ratio: 3"></div>
      <p>The graph contains in total of 55037 nodes where 55018 are members and 19 are genres. Genres can be found in the red ring 
        and members are given color based on their main genre aka. genre with highest weight. Members who only have worked with a single genre 
        are placed outside of the red ring with their corresponding genre and placed closer to the label the higher their weights are. 
        The documentary genre has a lot of members who has only been working with this genre multiple times whereas the war genre does not have any member with a single genre. 
        Members who have worked on multiple genres are placed inside the red ring, with their positions skewed towards mostly their main genre.
      </p>
      <p>Furthermore the 10 members with highest closeness centrality scores are highlighted as squares while eigenvalue centrality members are 
        highlighted as triangles. Most of the closeness members have drama as their main genre with comedy being second.
        The eigenvalue members are either drama or comedy, showing that these genres are also quite important for the members as well and may be why they joined the film industry. 
        Seing that none of these members are only </p>
      <!-- <p>By creating a random network with same edge probability, we get the following distribution over degrees:</p>
      <div class="center"><img src="imgs/random_distribution.png" alt="Result of random distribution analysis" width="1000px"></div>
      <p>The random distribution overlaps with our distribution at the beginning, but our distribution contains way more nodes with high degrees, indicating that members 
        either work in different genres  </p> -->

      <h1>Text analysis</h1>
      <p>Since we have summaries of each movie in the "overview" field, it is possible to perform a textual analysis on this data.
      We can achieve 19 different communities within the data by seperating the movies by genre, and treating all the movies in the same genre as a seperate community.
      Since there are 11 genres with less than 1000 movies, these will be filtered out since their contribution to the inverse document frequency across the communities will be minimal.
      This leaves 8 genres: "Comedy", "Drama", "Thriller", "Documentary", "Music", "Animation", "Horror" and "Science Fiction".</p>
      <p>Combining and tokenizing the overviews of every movie within these genres yields a list of tokens describing the genre.
      The tokens have been stemmed using the stemmer from the nltk python package, which uses regular expressions to filter out part of the terms.
      Once these lists of tokens were achieved, the term frequency for each genre could be calculated, as well as the overall inverse document frequency.
      With the term frequency and inverse document frequency in hand, it was possible to calculate TF-IDF scores for each genre.
      In the below figure a wordcloud is shown for each genre, depicting the 10 terms within each genre with the highest TF-IDF.</p>

      <div class="center"><img src="imgs/tf_idf_wordcloud.png" alt="Wordcloud over each movie genre" width="85%"></div>
      <p> The wordclouds showcase both the advantages and disadvantages of TF-IDF. Genres like "Comedy", "Horror" and "Science Fiction" have terms
        that are clearly descriptive of the genre to anyone who knows them. However, "Thriller" and "Documentary" are not as clear.
        They seem to be populated by rare names in specific movies that appear many times in that single movie's specific overview, since these unique names will be very rare across all documents.
        When comparing with the 10 terms with the highest term frequencies in "Thriller" and "Documentary", the words are no longer names, but are a lot less descriptive, with terms like "film" and "life" being the most common.
      </p><p>
        The TF-IDF scores clearly showcase that seperating the genres and treating each one as a seperate community is a very natural partition, but that the overviews also rely on being descripitive of the movies, and
        can be skewed heavily by having unique names appear many times within the same overview, thus resulting in a large TF-IDF score for that name.
        To define a movie clearly within a certain genre community, it is important to use descriptive terms, and avoiding the repetition of unique names and places too much.

      <h1 class="center">Conclusion</h1>
      <p class="center">From the network analysis, it was possible to include that the most central figures in the movie industry have worked often with 
        drama and comedy movies. Many crews form clear groupings within genres with some overlap, while a smaller subset works only with a single genre. 
        The genre overviews tells us that the movies are very distinct within each genre as well, as there is little overlap between the most descriptive 
        words for each genre.</p>

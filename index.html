      <h1 class="center">Introduction</h1>
      <h3 class="center">This is the project submission for the course 02467: <br> computational social science (spring)</h3>

      <h1 class="center">About this project</h1>
      <p>The goal of our investigation was to find out more about the movie industry than what is currently known by the general public. 
        This has been done by analyzing data collected from the movie database (TMDB) <a href="https://www.themoviedb.org/">https://www.themoviedb.org/</a>.
        Data collected and analyzed includes movies and their summaries, the crews producing the movies and the actors acting in them. 
        We aimed to explore the connections between the movies genres and production crew/cast using a bipartite network. 
        We aim to discover the figures who are the most diverse in genres, and how much an actor sticks to a genre.
        Then, to get a greater understanding of the movie's natural communities, their genres, a textual analysis has been performed on this community partition.</p>

      <h1>Dataset: movies</h1>
      <p>Our datasets have been retrieved from themoviedb as we have evaluated them to be the most reliable source for our research.
        We have two different datasets that can be linked to each other using the movie ID:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>The movie dataset contains information about movies from 2000-2024 that are available in English. The cleaned dataset consists of 199.897 movies
        There is a lot of information available on each of the movies including the title, original_language, genre, cast, crew and many more.</li>
        <li>The 'member' dataset contains information about the cast and crew working on the listed movies. The cleaned dataset holds 1.018.104 people, 
          including information about their name, known department, popularity, and the movie IDs they have worked in.</li>
      </ol>

    </div>  
    <div class="page">
      <h1>Graph</h1>
      <p>By connecting movie genres with movie crew and cast (refered to members in this work) a bipartite graph can be extracted, 
        with weights equal to number of movies a member has worked on before, which contains a given genre. As movie can have multiple genres, 
        a lot of members have worked in a few genre once. 
        We therefore apply a threshold level of minimum 5 movies which had the same genre in before an edge can be established. </p>
      <div class="center"><img src="imgs/graph_custom.png" alt="Bipartite graph with genre and member" width="1100px" height="700px" style="object-fit: cover;"></div>
      <p>The graph contains in total of 55037 nodes where 55018 are members and 19 are genres. Genres can be found in the red ring 
        and members are given color based on their main genre aka. genre with highest weight. Members who only have worked with a single genre 
        are placed outside of the red ring with their corresponding genre and placed closer to the label the higher their weights are. 
        The documentary genre has a lot of members who has only been working with this genre multiple times whereas the war genre does not have any member with a single genre. 
        Members who have worked on multiple genres are placed inside the red ring, with their positions skewed towards mostly their main genre.
      </p>
      <p>Furthermore the 10 members with highest closeness centrality scores are highlighted as squares while eigenvalue centrality members are 
        highlighted as triangles. Most of the closeness members have drama as their main genre with comedy being second.
        The eigenvalue members are either drama or comedy, showing that these genres are also quite important for the members as well and may be why they joined the film industry. 
        Seing that none of these members are only </p>
      <!-- <p>By creating a random network with same edge probability, we get the following distribution over degrees:</p>
      <div class="center"><img src="imgs/random_distribution.png" alt="Result of random distribution analysis" width="1000px"></div>
      <p>The random distribution overlaps with our distribution at the beginning, but our distribution contains way more nodes with high degrees, indicating that members 
        either work in different genres  </p> -->

      <h1>Text analysis</h1>
      <p> Since we have summaries of each movie in the "overview" column, it is possible to perform a textual analysis on this data. 
        We can achieve 19 different communities within the data by seperating the movies by genre, and treating all the movies in the same genre as a seperate community.
        Since there are 11 genres with less than 1000 movies, these will be filtered out since their contribution to the inverse document frequency across the communities will be minimal.
        This leaves 8 genres: "Comedy", "Drama", "Thriller", "Documentary", "Music", "Animation", "Horror" and "Science Fiction". </p>
      <p> Combining and tokenizing the overviews of every movie within these genres yields a list of tokens describing the genre.
        The tokens have been stemmed using the stemmer from the nltk python package, which uses regular expressions to filter out part of the terms.
        Once these lists of tokens were achieved, the term frequency for each genre could be calculated, as well as the overall inverse document frequency.
        With the term frequency and inverse document frequency in hand, it was possible to calculate TF-IDF scores for each genre.
        In the below figure a wordcloud is shown for each genre, depicting the 10 terms within each genre with the highest TF-IDF.</p>
      <div class="center"><img src="imgs/tf_idf_wordcloud.png" alt="Wordcloud over each movie genre" width="1000"></div>
      <p> The wordclouds showcase both the advantages and disadvantages of TF-IDF. Genres like "Comedy", "Horror" and "Science Fiction" have terms
        that are clearly descriptive of the genre to anyone who knows them. However, "Thriller" and "Documentary" are not as clear.
        They seem to be populated by rare names in specific movies that appear many times in that single movie's specific overview, since these unique names will be very rare across all docuemnts.
        When comparing witht the 10 terms with the highest term frequencies in "Thriller" and "Documentary", the words are no longer names, but are a lot less descriptive, with terms like "film" and "life" being the most common.
        The TF-IDF scores clearly showcase that seperating the genres and treating each one as a seperate community is a very natural partition, but that the overviews also rely on being descrpitive of the movies, and
        can be skewed heavily by having unique names appear many times within the same overview, thus resulting in a large TF-IDF score for that name.
        To define a movie clearly within a certain genre community, it is important to use descriptive terms, and avoiding the repetition of unique names and places too much.

      <h1 class="center">Conclusion</h1>
      <p class="center">From the network analysis, it was possible to include that the most central figures in the movie industry have worked often with 
        drama and comedy movies. Many crews form clear groupings within genres with some overlap, while a smaller subset works only with a single genre. 
        The genre overviews tells us that the movies are very distinct within each genre as well, as there is little overlap between the most descriptive 
        words for each genre.</p>

      <h1 class="center">Afterthoughts</h1>
      <p> Initially, we were also interested in investigating the role of gender in the entertainment industry. Unfortunately, this data point was very 
        inconsistent as well, as there were ~450.000 crew members with unspecified genders. We did some random samples on these and have concluded, 
        that not all listed as unspecified are in fact non-binary or similar. We therefore had to drop this column and also this investigation possibility.</p>
